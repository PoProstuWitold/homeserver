# Services
There are all services I made config for. All you need to do is follow instructions for particular service (such as change password) and run them either in ***Portainer*** (recommended) or just ``docker compose up -d`` 

In every case you need to run:
- [Cloudflare Tunnels](tunnels) - making services accesible outside your home network
- [Portainer](portainer) - easy managment for dockerized services

List of services. You can run and stop any amount or none of them in any order:
- [Jellyfin](jellyfin) - The Free Software Media System
- [NextCloud](nextcloud) - A Safe Home For All Your Data
- [Dashy](dashy) - A Self-Hostable Personal Dashboard
- [Mealie](mealie) - Recipe Management For The Modern Household
- [Briefkasten](briefkasten) - Self-Hosted Bookmarking App
- [Uptime Kuma](uptime_kuma) - A Fancy Self-Hosted Monitoring Tool
- [Minecraft](minecraft) - Minecraft server with your own IP
- [Watchtower](watchtower) - update your Docker containers automatically
- [Custom service](custom)
