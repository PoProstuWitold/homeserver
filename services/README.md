# Services
There are all services I made config for. All you need to do is follow instructions for particular service (such as change password) and run them either in ***Portainer*** (recommended) or just ``docker compose up -d`` 

In every case you need to run:
- [Cloudflare Tunnels](tunnels) - making services accesible outside your home network
- [Portainer](portainer) - easy managment for dockerized services

List of custom services. You can run and stop any amount or none of them in any order:
- [Jellyfin](jellyfin) - media server
- [NextCloud](nextcloud) - cloud
- [Dashy](dashy) - customizable dashboard for your home server
