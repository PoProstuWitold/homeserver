# Services - Port Forwarding
There are all services I made config for. All you need to do is follow instructions for particular service (such as change password) and run them either in Docker.

In every case you need to run:
- **[Caddy](caddy)** - makes your sites more secure, more reliable, and more scalable than any other solution.
- **[WireGuard VPN](wg_easy)** - the easiest way to run WireGuard VPN + Web-based Admin UI.
- **[Portainer](portainer)** - Easy Managment For Your Docker Stuff

Only required if you don't have static public IP:
- **[Cloudflare DDNS](cloudflare_ddns)** - small, feature-rich, and robust Cloudflare DDNS updater.
