# Starr Apps
These apps are collection managers for your `Jellyfin` media library. They require ***Jellyfin*** and ***qBitTorrent*** (or any other torrent app) to be running first.

For ease of setup, *Prowlarr* should be installed first. Order of remaining `*arr` apps doesn't really matter.
- ***[Prowlarr](prowlarr)*** - indexer manager/proxy with easy integration with other `*arr` apps.

Installing *Prowlarr* isn't essential but will make further setup and configuration much easier. Next are collection managers/organizers:
- ***[Radarr](radarr)*** - for movies
- ***[Sonarr](sonarr)*** - for TV shows or anime
- ***[Lidarr](lidarr)*** - for music
- ***[Readarr](readarr)*** - for ebooks

*Radarr* and *Sonarr* have great integration with *Jellyfin* and *Jellyseerr*. I recommend setting them first.
