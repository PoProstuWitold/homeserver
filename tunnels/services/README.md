# Services - Cloudflare Tunnels
There are all services I made config for. All you need to do is follow instructions for particular service (such as change password) and run them either in Docker.

In every case you need to run:
- **[Cloudflare Tunnels](tunnels)** - making services accesible outside your home network.
- **[Portainer](portainer)** - easy managment for your Docker stuff.

Personal preference:
- **[Jellyfin](jellyfin)** - the free software media system.
- **[jellyseerr](jellyseerr)** - an application for managing request for your media library.
- **[NextCloud](nextcloud)** - a safe home for all your data.
- **[Homarr](homarr)** - customizable browser's home page for your homeserver.
- **[Mealie](mealie)** - a recipe manager for the modern household.
- **[Linkding](linkding)** - selfhosted bookmark manager.
- **[Uptime Kuma](uptime_kuma)** - a fancy selfhosted monitoring tool.
- **[Minecraft](minecraft)** - Minecraft server with your own IP.
- **[Dashdot](dashdot)** - a modern server dashboard.
- **[Watchtower](watchtower)** - update your Docker containers automatically.
