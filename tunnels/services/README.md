# Services - Cloudflare Tunnels
There are all services I made config for. All you need to do is follow instructions for particular service (such as change password) and run them either in ***Portainer*** (recommended) or just ``docker compose up -d`` 

In every case you need to run:
- **[Cloudflare Tunnels](tunnels)** - making services accesible outside your home network
